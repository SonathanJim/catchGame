from kids library book of JS projects

This is the last project in the childrens coding instruction book 
'Generation Code: I'm A JavaScript Games Maker: The Basics' by Max Wainewright.

My son, Peter, borrowed it from Chesterfield Library recently and it
caught my eye as a nice fun project which can be easily 'personalised'
just swapping out the various elements.

The book teaches some very basic games using step by step instructions to type 
out scripts within a HTML file and just as a fun challenge while I study TOP 
I decided to test my knowledge by marking it all up in separate HTML/CSS/JS files.
